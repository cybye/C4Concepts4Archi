# C4Concepts4Archi

Archi model with some graphical elements from C4 Model https://c4model.com .

Mapping to Archimate is following the approach in https://www.archimatetool.com/blog/2020/04/18/c4-model-architecture-viewpoint-and-archi-4-7/ with the following exceptions:
- C4 relations are mapped to flow-relationship in Archimate. 
  
This requires Archi 4.9+ with coArchi 0.8+
